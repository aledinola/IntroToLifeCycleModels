%% Life-Cycle Model 36: Quasi-Hyperbolic Discounting
% Essentially quasi-hyperbolic discounting on Life-Cycle model 10

% Use Quasi-Hyperbolic discounting. I have put all the lines that relate to Quasi-hyperbolic discounting together to simplify reading.
% There are essentially three parts to using Quasi-Hyperbolic discounting.
% 1. Use vfoptions to state that you are using Quasi-Hyperbolic discounting.
% 2. Use vfoptions to state whether you want 'naive' or 'sophisticated' Quasi-Hyperbolic discounting.
% 3. Set the appropriate preference parameters.
% 4. 'discount factors'.

% 1. Use vfoptions to state that you are using Quasi-Hyperbolic discounting.
% The quasi-hyperbolic preferences are controlled using,
vfoptions.exoticpreferences='QuasiHyperbolic' % Use the quasi-hyperbolic preferences
% To turn off, either don't delare vfoptions.exoticpreferences, or set vfoptions.exoticpreferences='None'
% If you turn this off you would just solve the same model but with standard exponential discounting (parameter beta0 removed from discount factor by code below). 
% This is intended as purely illustrative. A serious comparison of the preference types would require you to recalibrate the model.

% 2. (optional) Use vfoptions to state whether you want 'naive' or 'sophisticated' Quasi-Hyperbolic discounting. (Optional as naive by default)
% Also need to choose which of the two quasi-hyperbolic solutions, naive or sophisticated, to use.
% vfoptions.quasi_hyperbolic='Naive' % This is the default, alternative is 'Sophisticated'.
vfoptions.quasi_hyperbolic='Sophisticated' % This is the default, alternative is 'Sophisticated'.

% 3. Set the appropriate preference parameters.
vfoptions.QHadditionaldiscount='beta0';
Params.beta0=0.85; % The quasi-hyperbolic discounting parameter controlling 'additional' discounting between 'today and tomorrow'
% Params.beta      % The quasi-hyperbolic discounting parameter controlling discounting between any two periods (note that once combined with the survival probabilites this give a discount factor that is typically less than one).
% Note that beta is set below.
% Note that setting beta0=1 would give standard exponential discounting.

% 4. Note, while we don't change the setup of the discount factors in DiscountFactorParamNames we do change their interpretation.

% That is all. Every other line of code is unchanged!! Quasi-Hyperbolic discounting really is that easy ;)

%% How does VFI Toolkit think about this?
%
% One endogenous state variable: a, assets (total household savings)
% One stochastic exogenous state variable: z, an AR(1) process (in logs), idiosyncratic shock to labor earnings
% Age: j

%% Begin setting up to use VFI Toolkit to solve
% Lets model agents from age 20 to age 100, so 81 periods

Params.agejshifter=19; % Age 20 minus one. Makes keeping track of actual age easy in terms of model age
Params.J=100-Params.agejshifter; % =81, Number of period in life-cycle

% Grid sizes to use
n_d=0;
n_a=201; % Endogenous asset holdings
n_z=21; % Exogenous labor productivity units shock
N_j=Params.J; % Number of periods in finite horizon

%% Parameters

% Discount rate
Params.beta = 0.96;
% Preferences
Params.sigma = 2; % Coeff of relative risk aversion (curvature of consumption)

% Prices
Params.w=1; % Wage
Params.r=0.05; % Interest rate (0.05 is 5%)

% Demographics
Params.agej=1:1:Params.J; % Is a vector of all the agej: 1,2,3,...,J
Params.Jr=46;

% Pensions
Params.pension=0.3;

% Age-dependent labor productivity units

Params.sigma_epsilon_z=0.03;

% Conditional survival probabilities: sj is the probability of surviving to be age j+1, given alive at age j
% Most countries have calculations of these (as they are used by the government departments that oversee pensions)
% In fact I will here get data on the conditional death probabilities, and then survival is just 1-death.
% Here I just use them for the US, taken from "National Vital Statistics Report, volume 58, number 10, March 2010."

%% Grids

% and putting more points near curvature (where the derivative changes the most) increases accuracy of results.

%% Now, we want to graph Life-Cycle Profiles

%% Initial distribution of agents at birth (j=1)
% Before we plot the life-cycle profiles we have to define how agents are
% at age j=1. We will give them all zero assets.
jequaloneDist=zeros([n_a,n_z],'gpuArray'); % Put no households anywhere on grid
jequaloneDist(1,floor((n_z+1)/2))=1; % All agents start with zero assets, and the median shock

%% We now compute the 'stationary distribution' of households
% Start with a mass of one at initial age, use the conditional survival
% probabilities sj to calculate the mass of those who survive to next
% period, repeat. Once done for all ages, normalize to one
Params.mewj=ones(1,Params.J); % Marginal distribution of households over age
for jj=2:length(Params.mewj)
    Params.mewj(jj)=Params.sj(jj-1)*Params.mewj(jj-1);
end
Params.mewj=Params.mewj./sum(Params.mewj); % Normalize to one
AgeWeightsParamNames={'mewj'}; % So VFI Toolkit knows which parameter is the mass of agents of each age
simoptions=struct(); % Use the default options
StationaryDist=StationaryDist_FHorz_Case1(jequaloneDist,AgeWeightsParamNames,Policy,n_d,n_a,n_z,N_j,pi_z,Params,simoptions);
% Again, we will explain in a later model what the stationary distribution
% is, it is not important for our current goal of graphing the life-cycle profile

%% FnsToEvaluate are how we say what we want to graph the life-cycles of
% Like with return function, we have to include (h,aprime,a,z) as first
% inputs, then just any relevant parameters.
FnsToEvaluate.earnings=@(aprime,a,z,w,kappa_j) w*kappa_j*z; % w*kappa_j*z*h is the labor earnings (note: h will be zero when z is zero, so could just use w*kappa_j*h)
FnsToEvaluate.assets=@(aprime,a,z) a; % a is the current asset holdings

% notice that we have called these fractiontimeworked, earnings and assets

%% Calculate the life-cycle profiles
AgeConditionalStats=LifeCycleProfiles_FHorz_Case1(StationaryDist,Policy,FnsToEvaluate,[],Params,n_d,n_a,n_z,N_j,d_grid,a_grid,z_grid,simoptions);

% There are things other than Mean, but in our current deterministic model
